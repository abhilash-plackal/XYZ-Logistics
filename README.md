# XYZ-Logistics
Django sample project

There are several branches to the logistic company XYZ, i.e, Root and Node_1 to Node_9. Root is the head branch.

Every node has a manager. i.e, Root has root_user and Node_x has manager_x. Funds can be transferred from a node to the other but only if they are parent-child nodes. Fund transfer can be done only by manager of the Root branch. It is assumed that Root already has a fixed amount of fund.

There are two types of groups for managers `root_users` and `node_managers`. Only managers in the `root_users` group can transfer the fund. 

PS: password for all the users `laptop1234`
